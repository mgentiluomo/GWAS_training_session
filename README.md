# GWAS Training Session
## Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Training Session

This repository contains the necessary materials and instructions to set up the working environment for the GWAS analysis training session.

The analysis will primarily use the command-line software **PLINK** and the statistical environment **R/RStudio** via an R Markdown notebook (`.Rmd`).

## 💻 Recommended System Requirements

To ensure a smooth experience during the session, the following hardware is recommended. Note that GWAS analysis can be memory (RAM) and disk space intensive, depending on the size of the dataset.

| Component | Minimum Recommendation | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux | The required software is compatible with all major operating systems. |
| **RAM (Memory)** | **8 GB** | **16 GB or more is highly recommended** for handling larger datasets. |
| **Storage (Disk Space)** | **50 GB** of free space | Required for software installations and the course data. |
| **Disk Type** | SSD (Solid State Drive) | Strongly recommended for faster data reading/writing speeds. |
| **Processor (CPU)** | Dual-core, 2.0 GHz or faster | A modern CPU will speed up calculation times. |
| **Internet Connection** | Stable | Necessary for downloading all required files and programs. |

## 🛠️ Class Environment Preparation Instructions

Please follow the steps below **before** the start of the session.

### **Phase 1: Setting up the Working Folder**

1.  Create a folder on your desktop called `Class_folder`. All working files and software will be downloaded here.

### **Phase 2: Software Download and Installation**

2.  **PLINK Software:**
    * Download the latest version of **PLINK 2.0** for your operating system.
    * **Download Link:** <https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/>
    * Save the executable file (e.g., `plink2.exe`) directly into your **`Class_folder`**.

3.  **R Base (Required):**
    * Download and install the **R** statistical programming language.
    * **Download Page (CRAN Mirror):** <https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html>
    * *Note:* RStudio Desktop requires a prior installation of R (version 3.6.0 or higher).

4.  **RStudio Desktop (Recommended):**
    * Download and install the **RStudio Desktop** Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    * **Download Page:** <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
    * *Note:* RStudio will make running the command notebook much easier.

### **Phase 3: Downloading Training Materials**

5.  **Command Notebook:**
    * Download the session command notebook file (with the **`.Rmd`** extension).
    * **File Link (To be updated with actual link):** `XXX`
    * Save this file into the **`Class_folder`**.

### **Phase 4: Final Check**

6.  Once all steps are completed successfully, locate the **`.Rmd`** file saved in `Class_folder`.
7.  **Double-click** the file. It should automatically open in **RStudio Desktop**.

**From this point, you can follow the instructions and code provided within the R Markdown notebook to proceed with the analysis.**
